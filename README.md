This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error: a missing requirements.txt file. The initial Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but the requirements file is absent, leading to a build failure.  The solution demonstrates how to include the requirements file correctly.
